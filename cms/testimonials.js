			title: 'Best wedding!',
			$text_type: 'textarea',
			text: 'Normally, food at weddings sucks. They have to cook everything hours in advance, so it can be transported, set up and reheated again in time for the reception. Yuck. That is why I brought a taster with me the last time I went to a wedding. He tasted all this awful food and pointed several things that were freshly made at location. Good wedding.'

			$text_type: 'textarea',
			text: 'My 3yo son complained about food quality at the kindergarten he goes to. I had enough of it and hired a professional taster to figure out if the food there is really that bad. After week of eating sliced apples and mashed potatoes he stated that the food is up to standard. I told my son if he can eat dirt and sand, he can also eat kindergarten food. Still packing him snacks so he doesn\'t get hungry thought.'

			title: 'Happy marriage',
			$text_type: 'textarea',
			text: 'We used to fight with my husband over which food is good and which is not. For example, I loved the steaks at mcConnelly\'s, but he said they were soggy and overcooked. We hired Mike from Boutique food tasters and he testified that the steak was in fact overcooked, made in microwave from bulk frozen store-bought package. Now I know.'
